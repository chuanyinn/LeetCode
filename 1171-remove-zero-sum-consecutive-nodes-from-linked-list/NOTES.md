Right idea, wrong data structure. (prefix_sum, and sum_map where key is the cumulative sum for fast searching, and deleting items sandwiched in between). "It seems like you're trying to manipulate a linked list to remove consecutive nodes that sum up to zero and return the modified list. However, the approach currently converts the linked list into an array and returns an array of values, which doesn't quite align with the problem's requirements."

â€‹Need to return the initial node that is the head of a `ListNode`
1. Initialize a dummy node: This helps to handle edge cases where the head itself is part of the sequence that sums to zero.
1. Use a hash map: Track the cumulative sum at each node and store the last occurrence of each cumulative sum in the hash map.
1. Traverse the list: For each node, calculate the cumulative sum. If the cumulative sum has been seen before, it means the nodes between the previous occurrence and the current node sum to zero. Remove these nodes.
1. Update the hash map: If the cumulative sum is seen for the first time, store it in the hash map.

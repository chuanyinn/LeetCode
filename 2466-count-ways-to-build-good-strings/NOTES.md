dp technique
1. Define a DP Array: Let `dp[i]` represent the number of ways to construct a string of length `i`. Initialize `dp[0]` to 1 because there's exactly one way to have an empty string.â€‹
2. Iterate through Possible Lengths: For each length from 1 to `high`, calculate the number of ways to construct strings of that length by considering the contributions from strings of shorter lengths.
3. Update DP Array: For each length `i`, add the number of ways to get to length `i` from length `i - zer`o and length `i - one`, if these lengths are non-negative.
4. Sum the Results for Valid Lengths: Finally, sum the values in `dp` for lengths between `low` and `high` to get the total number of good strings.

Initial attempt of nested for loop (outside loop over `n`, inside loop over `k`) greedy approach TLE.

â€‹Algorithm:
1. Initialize a Difference Array: We use a difference array to efficiently keep track of the range updates. The difference array helps to handle range updates in `O(1)` time complexity.
2. Apply the Operations: We iterate through the array, and for each element, if it is greater than 0, we apply the decrement operation on the next k elements (if possible).
3. Check Feasibility: During the iteration, if at any point we encounter an element that is greater than 0 but cannot be included in a subarray of size k (because it would go out of bounds), we return false.
4. Adjust the Difference Array: Use the difference array to simulate the decrement operation efficiently.

1. Define a function subtree_sum to calculate the sum of a current sub-tree labeled by the root node. This is mostly to calculate the total sum.
2. Define a function find_max_product to calculate the product of a sub-tree times the complement of it. In this function, it both calculates the subtree sum iteratively, and keeps track of the maximum of the product of the subtree broken off above the node and the complement of it.
3. nonlocal variableâ€‹s - so that local functions can edit variables defined one more global level higher.

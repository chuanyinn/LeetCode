Design decisions
1. Use `set` instead of `deque` for snake. Have variables for snake, snake set (for quick access), food index...
2. Check if valid (not crossing boundary or eating itself), and deleting tail and appending new head.
3. Do not need to implement while loop, as LC handles it on the backend.â€‹

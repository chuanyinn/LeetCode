â€‹Append lists of elements at a time, instead of one by one and checking corners.
1. Initialize boundaries for the top, bottom, left, and right edges of the matrix.
2. Traverse the matrix while updating the boundaries and collecting the elements in a spiral order.
3. Use a loop to move right across the top boundary, down the right boundary, left across the bottom boundary, and up the left boundary, adjusting the boundaries as you go.

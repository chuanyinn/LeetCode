We can utilize the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is particularly suitable for this problem because it explores all positions reachable in `k` steps before moving on to positions reachable in `k+1` steps, thus ensuring we find the shortest path.

â€‹Breadth-First Search (BFS):
1. Use a queue to keep track of the current position and the number of moves taken to reach that position.
2. Start from `[0,0]` with 0 moves.
3. For each position, enqueue all possible positions reachable in one knight move, unless already visited.
4. If we reach the target position `[x,y]`, return the number of moves.

Visited Set: Keep a set to track visited positions to avoid processing the same position multiple times, which ensures efficiency.

(Naively I was going to use recursion, but it does not reduce the problem space...)
